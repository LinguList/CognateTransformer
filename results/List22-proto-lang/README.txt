The results in this folder are generated for SVM-PosStr method described in [List et al. 22] on the data splits in data/proto-reconstruction. 
The code given in https://github.com/lingpy/supervised-reconstruction-paper is tweaked (fixing 10 fold cross-validation and 0.1, 0.5, 0.8 test proportions) and used for both data and result generations.
